## <ins> What is Docker? <ins>

- A platform where you can build, test, download, and deploy applications in containers.
- Quick auto scaling: Dynamically scale containers for load balancing and performance improvement.
- Containerize applications for deployment and storage
## <ins> What is Kubernetes? <ins>
- Platform where containerized apps are managed, deployed, and scaled through automation.
- Orchestrates clusters of virtual machines and tasks containers to run on those machines.
- Makes workloads portable and run applications through multiple environments with consistency.


## Why Choose Docker over Kubernetes?
- Simplicity: Easier, faster to use & setup. Requires less infrastructure & configuration compared to Kubernetes. Ideal for beginners or small scale projects
- Lower costs: Uses less resources. No complex orchestration. No vast clusters needed.
- Rapid Prototyping: Quickly setup containers without worrying about orchestration
- Seamless CI/CD integration: Works well with CI/CD pipelines in much simpler manner than Kubernetes due to portability, efficiency, and lightweight nature
- Standalone Apps: Great for standalone apps on a single machine
