# What is Docker?

- A platform where you can build, test, download,
and deploy applications in containers.
- Quick auto-scaling: Dynamically scale containers
for load balancing and performance improvement.
- Containerize applications for deployment and storage.

## What is Kubernetes?

- A platform where containerized apps are managed,
deployed, and scaled through automation.
- Orchestrates clusters of virtual machines
and tasks containers to run on those machines.
- Makes workloads portable and runs applications
through multiple environments with consistency.

## Why Choose Docker over Kubernetes?

- **Simplicity**: Easier, faster to use & setup. Requires less infrastructure
& configuration compared to Kubernetes.
Ideal for beginners or small-scale projects.
- **Lower costs**: Uses fewer resources. No complex orchestration.
No vast clusters are needed.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly set up containers
without worrying about orchestration.
- **Seamless CI/CD integration**: Works well with CI/CD pipelines
in a much simpler manner than Kubernetes due to
portability, efficiency, and lightweight nature.
- **Standalone Apps**: Great for standalone apps on a single machine.
